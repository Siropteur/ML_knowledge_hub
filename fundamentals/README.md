## ðŸ“– Best Practices for Each Folder

- README.md â†’ short intro, why it matters for ML, key formulas.

- .md files â†’ theory explanations with diagrams.

- practice.ipynb â†’ Jupyter notebooks with simple Python/Numpy examples.

- Optional: references.md â†’ links to textbooks, blogs, videos.

## ðŸŒŸ Suggested Learning Flow

- Linear Algebra â†’ how data and models are represented.

- Calculus â†’ how models learn (gradients, optimization).

- Probability & Statistics â†’ uncertainty, modeling distributions.

- Optimization â†’ how training actually works.

- Linear Models â†’ first ML algorithms tying math â†’ practice.
